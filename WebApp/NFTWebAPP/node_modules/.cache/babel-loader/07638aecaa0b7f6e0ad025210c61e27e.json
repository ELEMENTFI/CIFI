The server\r\n * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the\r\n * client key exchange.\r\n *\r\n * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).\r\n *\r\n * 1. Client sends ClientHello.\r\n * 2. Client receives ServerHello.\r\n * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.\r\n * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.\r\n * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.\r\n * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.\r\n * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.\r\n * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.\r\n * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.\r\n * 10. Client sends Finished.\r\n * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.\r\n * 12. Client receives Finished.\r\n * 13. Client sends/receives application data.\r\n *\r\n * To reuse an existing session:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.\r\n * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.\r\n * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.\r\n * 4. Client receives Finished.\r\n * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.\r\n * 6. Client sends Finished.\r\n *\r\n * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.\r\n *\r\n * Record Layer:\r\n *\r\n * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records\r\n * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are\r\n * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the\r\n * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a\r\n * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   uint8 major;\r\n *   uint8 minor;\r\n * } ProtocolVersion;\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   ContentType type;\r\n *   ProtocolVersion version;\r\n *   uint16 length;\r\n *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];\r\n * } TLSPlaintext;\r\n *\r\n * type:\r\n *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.\r\n *\r\n * version:\r\n *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version\r\n *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that\r\n *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be\r\n *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.\r\n *\r\n * length:\r\n *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length\r\n *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.\r\n *\r\n * fragment:\r\n *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an\r\n *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified\r\n *   by the type field.\r\n *\r\n * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or\r\n * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data\r\n * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis\r\n * countermeasure.\r\n *\r\n * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.\r\n * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than\r\n * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in\r\n * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST\r\n * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes\r\n * subsequent to the first one on a connection.\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   ContentType type;       // same as TLSPlaintext.type\r\n *   ProtocolVersion version;// same as TLSPlaintext.version\r\n *   uint16 length;\r\n *   opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];\r\n * } TLSCompressed;\r\n *\r\n * length:\r\n *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.\r\n *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.\r\n *\r\n * fragment:\r\n *   The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.\r\n *\r\n * Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no fields\r\n * are altered. In this implementation, since no compression is supported,\r\n * uncompressed records are always the same as compressed records.\r\n *\r\n * Encryption Information:\r\n *\r\n * The encryption and MAC functions translate a TLSCompressed structure into a\r\n * TLSCiphertext. The decryption functions reverse the process. The MAC of the\r\n * record also includes a sequence number so that missing, extra, or repeated\r\n * messages are detectable.\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   ContentType type;\r\n *   ProtocolVersion version;\r\n *   uint16 length;\r\n *   select (SecurityParameters.cipher_type) {\r\n *     case stream: GenericStreamCipher;\r\n *     case block:  GenericBlockCipher;\r\n *     case aead:   GenericAEADCipher;\r\n *   } fragment;\r\n * } TLSCiphertext;\r\n *\r\n * type:\r\n *   The type field is identical to TLSCompressed.type.\r\n *\r\n * version:\r\n *   The version field is identical to TLSCompressed.version.\r\n *\r\n * length:\r\n *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCiphertext.fragment.\r\n *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 2048.\r\n *\r\n * fragment:\r\n *   The encrypted form of TLSCompressed.fragment, with the MAC.\r\n *\r\n * Note: Only CBC Block Ciphers are supported by this implementation.\r\n *\r\n * The TLSCompressed.fragment structures are converted to/from block\r\n * TLSCiphertext.fragment structures.\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   opaque IV[SecurityParameters.record_iv_length];\r\n *   block-ciphered struct {\r\n *     opaque content[TLSCompressed.length];\r\n *     opaque MAC[SecurityParameters.mac_length];\r\n *     uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];\r\n *     uint8 padding_length;\r\n *   };\r\n * } GenericBlockCipher;\r\n *\r\n * The MAC is generated as described in Section 6.2.3.1.\r\n *\r\n * IV:\r\n *   The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be\r\n *   unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no\r\n *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the \"CBC\r\n *   residue\") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks\r\n *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length\r\n *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the\r\n *   SecurityParameters.block_size.\r\n *\r\n * padding:\r\n *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an\r\n *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be\r\n *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the\r\n *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.\r\n *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on\r\n *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged\r\n *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the\r\n *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use\r\n *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.\r\n *\r\n * padding_length:\r\n *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the\r\n *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.\r\n *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the\r\n *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.\r\n *\r\n * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of\r\n * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,\r\n * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.\r\n *\r\n * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length\r\n * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the\r\n * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the\r\n * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length\r\n * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be\r\n * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum\r\n * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.\r\n * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption\r\n * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.\r\n *\r\n * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical\r\n * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is\r\n * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack\r\n * described in [CBCATT].\r\n *\r\n * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing\r\n * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In\r\n * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that\r\n * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding\r\n * is correct. In general, the best way to do this is to compute the MAC even\r\n * if the padding is incorrect, and only then reject the packet. For instance,\r\n * if the pad appears to be incorrect, the implementation might assume a\r\n * zero-length pad and then compute the MAC. This leaves a small timing\r\n * channel, since MAC performance depends, to some extent, on the size of the\r\n * data fragment, but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable,\r\n * due to the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the\r\n * timing signal.\r\n */\nvar forge = require('./forge');\n\nrequire('./asn1');\n\nrequire('./hmac');\n\nrequire('./md5');\n\nrequire('./pem');\n\nrequire('./pki');\n\nrequire('./random');\n\nrequire('./sha1');\n\nrequire('./util');\n/**\r\n * Generates pseudo random bytes by mixing the result of two hash functions,\r\n * MD5 and SHA-1.\r\n *\r\n * prf_TLS1(secret, label, seed) =\r\n *   P_MD5(S1, label + seed) XOR P_SHA-1(S2, label + seed);\r\n *\r\n * Each P_hash function functions as follows:\r\n *\r\n * P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +\r\n *                        HMAC_hash(secret, A(2) + seed) +\r\n *                        HMAC_hash(secret, A(3) + seed) + ...\r\n * A() is defined as:\r\n *   A(0) = seed\r\n *   A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))\r\n *\r\n * The '+' operator denotes concatenation.\r\n *\r\n * As many iterations A(N) as are needed are performed to generate enough\r\n * pseudo random byte output.

The return value must be a\r\n *   PEM-formatted certificate or an array of PEM-formatted certificates\r\n *   that constitute a certificate chain, with the first in the array/chain\r\n *   being the client's certificate.\r\n * getPrivateKey(conn, certificate)\r\n *   The second parameter is an forge.pki X.509 certificate object that\r\n *   is associated with the requested private key.

The second parameter is a\r\n *   string of bytes to be signed that are part of the TLS protocol. These\r\n *   bytes are used to verify that the private key for the previously\r\n *   provided client-side certificate is accessible to the client. The\r\n *   callback is a function that takes 2 parameters, the TLS connection\r\n *   and the RSA encrypted (signed) bytes as a string. This callback must\r\n *   be called once the signature is ready.\r\n *\r\n * @param options the options for this connection:\r\n *   server: true if the connection is server-side, false for

* A Javascript implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS).\r\n *\r\n * @author Dave Longley\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) 2009-2014 Digital Bazaar, Inc.\r\n *\r\n * The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:\r\n *\r\n * - Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random values,\r\n * and check for session resumption.\r\n *\r\n * - Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the client and\r\n * server to agree on a premaster secret.\r\n *\r\n * - Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the client\r\n * and server to authenticate themselves.\r\n *\r\n * - Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random\r\n * values.\r\n *\r\n * - Provide security parameters to the record layer.\r\n *\r\n * - Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has calculated the\r\n * same security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering\r\n * by an attacker.\r\n *\r\n * Up to 4 different messages may be sent during a key exchange. The server\r\n * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the\r\n * client key exchange.\r\n *\r\n * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).\r\n *\r\n * 1. Client sends ClientHello.\r\n * 2. Client receives ServerHello.\r\n * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.\r\n * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.\r\n * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.\r\n * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.\r\n * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.\r\n * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.\r\n * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.\r\n * 10. Client sends Finished.\r\n * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.\r\n * 12. Client receives Finished.\r\n * 13. Client sends/receives application data.\r\n *\r\n * To reuse an existing session:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.\r\n * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.\r\n * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.\r\n * 4. Client receives Finished.\r\n * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.\r\n * 6. Client sends Finished.\r\n *\r\n * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.\r\n *\r\n * Record Layer:\r\n *\r\n * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records\r\n * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are\r\n * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the\r\n * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a\r\n * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   uint8 major;\r\n *   uint8 minor;\r\n * } ProtocolVersion;\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   ContentType type;\r\n *   ProtocolVersion version;\r\n *   uint16 length;\r\n *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];\r\n * } TLSPlaintext;\r\n *\r\n * type:\r\n *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.\r\n *\r\n * version:\r\n *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version\r\n *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that\r\n *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be\r\n *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.\r\n *\r\n * length:\r\n *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length\r\n *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.\r\n *\r\n * fragment:\r\n *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an\r\n *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified\r\n *   by the type field.\r\n *\r\n * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or\r\n * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data\r\n * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis\r\n * countermeasure.\r\n *\r\n * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.\r\n * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than\r\n * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in\r\n * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST\r\n * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes\r\n * subsequent to the first one on a connection.\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   ContentType type;       // same as TLSPlaintext.type\r\n *   ProtocolVersion version;// same as TLSPlaintext.version\r\n *   uint16 length;\r\n *   opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];\r\n * } TLSCompressed;\r\n *\r\n * length:\r\n *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.\r\n *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.\r\n *\r\n * fragment:\r\n *   The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.\r\n *\r\n * Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no fields\r\n * are altered. In this implementation, since no compression is supported,\r\n * uncompressed records are always the same as compressed records.\r\n *\r\n * Encryption Information:\r\n *\r\n * The encryption and MAC functions translate a TLSCompressed structure into a\r\n * TLSCiphertext. The decryption functions reverse the process. The MAC of the\r\n * record also includes a sequence number so that missing, extra, or repeated\r\n * messages are detectable.\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   ContentType type;\r\n *   ProtocolVersion version;\r\n *   uint16 length;\r\n *   select (SecurityParameters.cipher_type) {\r\n *     case stream: GenericStreamCipher;\r\n *     case block:  GenericBlockCipher;\r\n *     case aead:   GenericAEADCipher;\r\n *   } fragment;\r\n * } TLSCiphertext;\r\n *\r\n * type:\r\n *   The type field is identical to TLSCompressed.type.\r\n *\r\n * version:\r\n *   The version field is identical to TLSCompressed.version.\r\n *\r\n * length:\r\n *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCiphertext.fragment.\r\n *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 2048.\r\n *\r\n * fragment:\r\n *   The encrypted form of TLSCompressed.fragment, with the MAC.\r\n *\r\n * Note: Only CBC Block Ciphers are supported by this implementation.\r\n *\r\n * The TLSCompressed.fragment structures are converted to/from block\r\n * TLSCiphertext.fragment structures.\r\n *\r\n * struct {\r\n *   opaque IV[SecurityParameters.record_iv_length];\r\n *   block-ciphered struct {\r\n *     opaque content[TLSCompressed.length];\r\n *     opaque MAC[SecurityParameters.mac_length];\r\n *     uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];\r\n *     uint8 padding_length;\r\n *   };\r\n * } GenericBlockCipher;\r\n *\r\n * The MAC is generated as described in Section 6.2.3.1.\r\n *\r\n * IV:\r\n *   The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be\r\n *   unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no\r\n *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the \"CBC\r\n *   residue\") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks\r\n *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length\r\n *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the\r\n *   SecurityParameters.block_size.\r\n *\r\n * padding:\r\n *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an\r\n *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be\r\n *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the\r\n *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.\r\n *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on\r\n *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged\r\n *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the\r\n *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use\r\n *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.\r\n *\r\n * padding_length:\r\n *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the\r\n *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.\r\n *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the\r\n *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.\r\n *\r\n * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of\r\n * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,\r\n * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.\r\n *\r\n * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length\r\n * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the\r\n * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the\r\n * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length\r\n * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be\r\n * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum\r\n * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.\r\n * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption\r\n * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.\r\n *\r\n * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical\r\n * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is\r\n * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack\r\n * described in [CBCATT].\r\n *\r\n * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing\r\n * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In\r\n * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that\r\n * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding\r\n * is correct.

This does not make any assumptions about the\r\n * transport layer that TLS is working on top of, ie: it does not assume there\r\n * is a TCP/IP connection or establish one. A TLS connection is totally\r\n * abstracted away from the layer is runs on top of, it merely establishes a\r\n * secure channel between a client\" and a \"server\".\r\n *\r\n * A TLS connection contains 4 connection states: pending read and write, and\r\n * current read and write.\r\n *\r\n * At initialization, the current read and write states will be null. Only once\r\n * the security parameters have been set and the keys have been generated can\r\n * the pending states be converted into current states. Current states will be\r\n * updated for each record processed.\r\n *\r\n * A custom certificate verify callback may be provided to check information\r\n * like the common name on the server's certificate. It will be called for\r\n * every certificate in the chain. It has the following signature:\r\n *\r\n * variable func(c, certs, index, preVerify)\r\n * Where:\r\n * c         The TLS connection\r\n * verified  Set to true if certificate was verified, otherwise the alert\r\n *           tls.Alert.Description for why the certificate failed.\r\n * depth     The current index in the chain, where 0 is the server's cert.\r\n * certs     The certificate chain, *NOTE* if the server was anonymous then\r\n *           the chain will be empty.\r\n *\r\n * The function returns true on success and on failure either the appropriate\r\n * tls.Alert.Description or an object with 'alert' set to the appropriate\r\n * tls.Alert.Description and 'message' set to a custom error message. If true\r\n * is not returned then the connection will abort using, in order of\r\n * availability, first the returned alert description, second the preVerify\r\n * alert description, and lastly the default 'bad_certificate'.\r\n *\r\n * There are three callbacks that can be used to make use of client-side\r\n * certificates where each takes the TLS connection as the first parameter:\r\n *\r\n * getCertificate(conn, hint)\r\n *   The second parameter is a hint as to which certificate should be\r\n *   returned. If the connection entity is a client, then the hint will be\r\n *   the CertificateRequest message from the server that is part of the\r\n *   TLS protocol. If the connection entity is a server, then it will be\r\n *   the servername list provided via an SNI extension the ClientHello, if\r\n *   one was provided (empty array if not). The hint can be examined to\r\n *   determine which certificate to use (advanced). Most implementations\r\n *   will just return a certificate. The return value must be a\r\n *   PEM-formatted certificate or an array of PEM-formatted certificates\r\n *   that constitute a certificate chain, with the first in the array/chain\r\n *   being the client's certificate.\r\n * getPrivateKey(conn, certificate)\r\n *   The second parameter is an forge.pki X.509 certificate object that\r\n *   is associated with the requested private key. The return value must\r\n *   be a PEM-formatted private key.\r\n * getSignature(conn, bytes, callback)\r\n *   This callback can be used instead of getPrivateKey if the private key\r\n *   is not directly accessible in javascript or should not be. For\r\n *   instance, a secure external web service could provide the signature\r\n *   in exchange for appropriate credentials. The second parameter is a\r\n *   string of bytes to be signed that are part of the TLS protocol. These\r\n *   bytes are used to verify that the private key for the previously\r\n *   provided client-side certificate is accessible to the client. The\r\n *   callback is a function that takes 2 parameters, the TLS connection\r\n *   and the RSA encrypted (signed) bytes as a string. This callback must\r\n *   be called once the signature is ready.\r\n *\r\n * @param options the options for this connection:\r\n *   server: true if the connection is server-side, false for client.\r\n *   sessionId: a session ID to reuse, null for a new connection.\r\n *   caStore: an array of certificates to trust.\r\n *   sessionCache: a session cache to use.\r\n *   cipherSuites: an optional array of cipher suites to use,\r\n *     see tls.CipherSuites.\r\n *   connected: function(conn) called when the first handshake completes.\r\n *   virtualHost: the virtual server name to use in a TLS SNI extension.\r\n *   verifyClient: true to require a client certificate in server mode,\r\n *     'optional' to request one, false not to (default: false).\r\n *   verify: a handler used to custom verify certificates in the chain.\r\n *   getCertificate: an optional callback used to get a certificate or\r\n *     a chain of certificates (as an array).\r\n *   getPrivateKey: an optional callback used to get a private key.\r\n *   getSignature: an optional callback used to get a signature.\r\n *   tlsDataReady: function(conn) called when TLS protocol data has been\r\n *     prepared and is ready to be used (typically sent over a socket\r\n *     connection to its destination), read from conn.tlsData buffer.\r\n *   dataReady: function(conn) called when application data has\r\n *     been parsed from a TLS record and should be consumed by the\r\n *     application, read from conn.data buffer.\r\n *   closed: function(conn) called when the connection has been closed.\r\n *   error: function(conn, error) called when there was an error.\r\n *   deflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will deflate TLS records using\r\n *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.\r\n *   inflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will inflate TLS records using\r\n *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.\r\n *\r\n * @return the new TLS connection.\r\n */\r\nforge.tls.createConnection = tls.createConnection;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
